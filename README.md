# Lichess Stockfish
A simple python implementation of a stockfish interface that works with lichess.org.  
Works thanks to https://github.com/SindreSvendby/pgnToFen.  
For optional Syzygy tablebases hookup, uncomment line that leads to Syzygy tablebases path.

<b>Don't forget to change path to stockfish.exe inside Lichess_Stockfish.py !</b>
